App using Angular, Express.js and MySQL. It contains:
  - Database CRUD through frontend interface
  - Filters for reading Influencers

  - Authorization required for app access
  - Encrypted passwords in the database with MD5 Hash + Secret
  - Unitary tests for Http requests and data integrity
  - MSC Architecture
  - REST API

## How to:
I **strongly** recommend you read and follow these steps in order:

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Deployment: </strong>
  </summary>
  
  - https://influencer-app-production.up.railway.app/
  - Note:
    - Railway HATES reloading pages and the DB queries are inconsistent in how long they take.
    - If you Refresh the page it WILL **kill** the app. If you edit, add or delete an entry and it does not seem to reflect in the List, click any button that would navigate you (such as `SHOW ALL`, `+NEW` or `EDIT`) away from the list and come back to it via `SHOW ALL` and it will show, I promise!

  <summary>
    <strong>üåê Environment Setup</strong>
  </summary> <br>
    
  - Front-End's **frontend/src/environment/environment.ts** : You need to `export` a `const` object that constains a key called `baseApiUrl` and whose value is an appropriate host url such as `http://localhost:3333`
  
  - Back-End's **.env.EXAMPLE** : Rename it to just `.env` and then add your own values to connect to the database

    <strong>‚úÖ To do:</strong>
  </summary>

  - Store database fetch to `localstorage` for `influencer array`
  - Pagination for database fetch of `influencer array`
  - Unitary tests for component integrity beyond just Http requests
  - New column for database `priviliges` that dictates access type (Admin, User, etc)
  - Data validation schemas for the Backend's Service layer
  - Better error handling by the Frontend when receiving Http responses (currently just catching it and ignoring it)
  - Multiple filters active at once
  - A switch for Numeric Filter to swap between `>` and `<` searches (currently only `>`)
  - Better colors
